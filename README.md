# Swift-Examples

I am learning Swift and need to make lots of practice. I am planning to put my swift examples here and I think it is good to make a list like what I have done or what I am going to do. 
I am open your to-do suggestions also.



## TO-DO

* Optionals
* Closures

* Networking
* JSON Parse
* TableView & CollectionView Usage
* .
